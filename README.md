# 🎬 Netflix SQL Project

This project explores the Netflix titles dataset using SQL queries to uncover patterns and insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform. The dataset contains information such as title, type, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, genre, and date added to Netflix.

By applying structured SQL queries, this project demonstrates how to efficiently analyze large datasets and transform raw data into meaningful insights.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1.  **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure of the Netflix dataset and identify key attributes for analysis.
2.  **Querying with SQL:** Apply SQL techniques such as filtering, aggregation, grouping, and joins to answer analytical questions.
3.  **Content Insights:** Analyze Netflix’s catalog distribution across movies and TV shows, release trends, and geographic patterns.
4.  **Category Classification:** Categorize titles based on ratings, genres, and duration for better segmentation.
5.  **Trend Analysis:** Explore how content additions vary across countries and years, highlighting Netflix’s global expansion.

## 🔑 Key Findings

* **Catalog Size:** The dataset provides thousands of Netflix titles, with a higher share of TV shows compared to Movies.
