# 🎬 Netflix SQL & Power BI Project: Data Analysis & Visualization

This project explores the Netflix titles dataset to uncover patterns and insights. It includes two main components:
1.  **SQL Analysis:** Using SQL queries to explore, clean, and analyze the raw data.
2.  **Power BI Dashboard:** Visualizing the key findings in an interactive dashboard.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

Below are screenshots of the interactive dashboard. The full, interactive `.pbix` file (`Netflix project.pbix`) is included in this repository.
